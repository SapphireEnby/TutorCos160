Assignments for Spring 2017 COS 160
Completed as a tutor

The included files are assignments for the Spring 2017 Cos 160 Course

taught by Robert Boothe at University of Southern Maine

At the time I was a Computer Science tutor and already completed the course...
but as the assignments weren't the same as when I was enrolled in Cos 160
I found it neccisarry to complete the assignments and keep up with the material, 
to better my ability to assist students seeking proper help.
