Assignments for Spring 2017 COS 160, Completed as a Tutor
The included files are assignments for the Spring 2017 Cos 160 Course taught by Robert Boothe at University Of Southern Maine
At the time I was a Computer Science tutor and already completed the course, but as the assignments weren't the same as when I took the course
I found it neccisarry to complete the assignments and keep up with the material.
